Task 1:
MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. The model utilizes techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings in combination with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

The goal is to accurately classify movies into their respective genres, providing a valuable tool for content recommendation systems and movie database organization. The model's performance will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Task 2:
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

This project focuses on developing a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing information about credit card transactions. The model will experiment with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

The aim is to create a robust and accurate fraud detection system that can help financial institutions identify and prevent fraudulent activities, thereby safeguarding the interests of both the institutions and their customers. The model's performance will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Task 3:
SPAM SMS DETECTION

This project aims to develop an AI model for classifying SMS messages as either spam or legitimate. The model will leverage techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings in combination with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.

The objective is to create a reliable system for automatically detecting and filtering out spam messages, thereby enhancing user experience and security in SMS communication. The model's performance will be assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
